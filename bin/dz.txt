<> Doszip Commander File List

    DZBINXXX.ZIP: Program files

    DZ.EXE	- DZ Main Shell
    DZ.TXT	- DZ Help file (this file)
    LICENSE.TXT - GNU General Public License

    DZSRCXXX.ZIP: Source code

    SRC		- The source files are contained here
    HISTORY.TXT - Changelog file for Doszip

    The date format is dd.mm.yy[yy]

    The first time you run DZ.EXE, it creates a default configuration
    file (DZ.INI).


<> Command Line

    Command	Description
    ---------	------------------------------------------------------
    /C<path>	Set Configuration PATH to <path>
    /cmd	Start DZ and show only command prompt
    /E:<file>	Save environment block to <file>
    /nologo	Suppress copyright message

<> Compressed File Support

    Password protected Compressed files
    -----------------------------------

    While the Doszip Commander Compression Engine is compatible with
    PKZIP 1.x and PKZIP 2.x compress file formats, Commander only
    allows a single password for each compressed file to be active.

    The internal compression configuration is set by Ctrl-J


<> Viewer Support

    All viewers are defined in the file DZ.INI. You can modify the [View]
    section of DZ.INI file to associated 4 viewers:

    [View]
    F3	  = ; You can override the internal viewer by redefine F3
    Alt	  = ; Viewer for Alt+F3
    Ctrl  = ; Viewer for Ctrl+F3
    Shift = ; Viewer for Shift+F3

    Internal Viewer
    ---------------

    To launch the internal viewer contained within DZ.EXE, type F3. The
    macro %VIEW% may be used to associated files to the internal viewer
    in the DZ.INI file:

    [Filetype]
    txt = %view%


<> Editor Support

    All editors are defined in the file DZ.INI. You can modify the [Edit]
    section of DZ.INI file to associated 4 editors:

    [Edit]
    F4	  = ; You can override the internal editor by redefine F4
    Alt	  = ; Editor for Alt+F4
    Ctrl  = ; Editor for Ctrl+F4
    Shift = ; Editor for Shift+F4


<> Internal Editor

    To launch the internal editor contained within DZ.EXE, type F4. The
    macro %EDIT% may be used to associated files to the internal editor
    in the DZ.INI file:

    [Tools]
    0 = &Add tool, %edit% %dz%\dz.ini

    of the DZ.INI file to associate external comands:

    [ShiftF3]
    asm	 = ASMC -I%dzinc%
    c	 = WCC -ml

    The syntax is equal to the section [Filetype]. The sections
    [Shift/Alt-FX] parse a ".err" file if exist.


    Syntax highlighting
    -------------------

    Style codes:

    1. Attrib	A - Set background and forground color
    2. Control	O - Set color of CONTROL characters
    3. Quote	Q - Set color of quoted text
    4. Digit	D - Set color of numbers
    5. Char	C - Set color of chars
    6. String	S - Set color of string
    7. Begin	B - Set color from start of string
    8. Word	W - Set color of words
    9. Nested	N - Set color of nested strings

    The code have the following syntax:

    [<name>]
    0 = <attrib>[ <string>][ <string2>]...
    1 = ...

    Attrib: Color and character, or color (default is space (20h))
    0=A 07 FA

    Control: Color
    0=O 4X

    Quote: Color
    0=Q XB

    Digit: Color
    0=D XB

    Char: Color and char(s)
    0=C XF $%()

    String: Color and string
    0=S 4X Error

    Begin: Color and string(s)
    0=B X6 # include

    Word: Color and word(s)
    0=W X4 ax bx cx dx al bl cl dl
    1=ds es cs ss

    Nested: Color, string1 and string2
    0=N X8 /* */

    File type definition
    --------------------

    Code for syntax is located in the DZ.INI file, and file types
    must be defined under the section [Style]

    [Style]
    asm = style_asm
    inc = style_asm

    .ASM and .INC files will now use the section [style_asm]

    The editor reads this section which have the following syntax:

    [<section_name>]
    <Id>=<section> | [<section>] | [#<file>]
    [<section>]
    <code>


<> Hex Editor

    To launch the internal hex editor contained within DZ.EXE, type Ctrl-F4.

    Keyboard

    Class edit
    ----------
    Enter		Select type
    Ctrl-Home		Top of file
    Ctrl-End		End of file


<> Extension and Filename Support

    Defining Filetypes
    ------------------
    You can modify the [Filetype] section to associated files in the format
    as follows:

    <ext>  = <command> !.! ; filetype
    <name> = <command>	   ; filename (no ext)

    File macros:

    !!		!
    !:		Drive + ':'
    !\		Long path
    !		Long file name
    .!		Long extension
    !~\		Short path
    ~!		Short file name
    .!~		Short extension

    Default (no macro used):

    'Long_Name.foo' --> '<command> Long_Name.foo'
    'Long Name.foo' --> '<command> "Long Name.foo"'

    Quotations are not added if macros are used:

    - Short: txt=edit ~!.!~
    - Long:  txt=notepad "!:!\\!.!"

    Multiple commands are parsed to a batch file. Use the ", " to separate
    the commands.

    Example: README.TXT

    [Filetype]
    TXT=echo !, echo .!, echo !.!

    Expands to a batch file:

    @echo off
    echo README
    echo .TXT
    echo README.TXT


<> Doszip Commander Environment Variables

    Doszip searches your environment for the following environment
    variables: COMSPEC, PATH, TEMP and DZ.

    The %DZ% variable may be used on the command line or in the .INI file.
    It is the path on your hard disk where the documents and configuration
    files are stored. The %DOSZIP% variable is the path where the commander
    is located.

    The value of %DZ% may be set in the environment (SET DZ=<path>), or on
    the command line (/C<path>). Command line overwrites environment.
    The default value is equal to %DOSZIP%.

    The variable COMSPEC will be overwritten by the [Comspec] value if
    defined:

    [Comspec]
    0=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CMD.EXE
    1=/C

    This will force Doszip to use CMD.EXE insted of COMMAND.COM
    To define a single-line program, just exclude the 1= value:

    [Comspec]
    0=D:\CYGWIN\BIN\BASH.EXE

    The use of the .INI setting is controlled by the [x] Use NT Prompt
    in the System Options dialog. If set this will be used to execute
    commands except from the following:

      - execution of .BAT files
      - commands including '<' or '>'
      - some special 16-bit executables

    In that case the %COMSPEC% variable will be used.

    Edit Environment
    ----------------

    To launch the internal editor contained within DZ.EXE, type Shift-F5.

    Keyboard
    --------

    F2	Add a new environment string
    F3	Load environment from a file
    F4	Edit environment string
    F5	Save environment to a file
    F8	Delete environment string


<> Installing Commander under Windows

    Right click your desktop, select New->Shortcut.
    Type in the full path name of the DZ.EXE file, e.g. C:\DZ\DZ.EXE,
    or use the browse button if you are not sure of the path.

    Select the OK button.

    The Doszip Commander is now installed on your desktop.


<> Creating a tools menu

    It is possible to add a user defined Tools Menu to the Doszip
    Commander's main menu.

    All Tool-items are defined in the file DZ.INI. You can modify the
    [Tools] section of DZ.INI to associated 20 Tool-items: [00..19]

    To define a Menu item use the following format:

    X = <> ; Insert a line
    X = Menu_Item_Name, Command_to_be_invoked_when_selected
    X = Menu_Item_Name, [Menu_to_be_invoked_when_selected]

    Macros that can be used in 'Command' expand as follows:

    %EDIT%  [Edit] --> F4=<> | Internal editor
    %VIEW%  [View] --> F3=<> | Internal viewer
    %FIND%  Internal File Search(command)

    These must be the first command on the line.
    The macro %DOSZIP% and %DZ% may appear any place in the command line.

    You can insert commands into a sub-menu in the same way described above.

    For example a simple Tools Menu may look like:

    [Tools]
    0 = &Add tool,%EDIT% %DZ%\DZ.INI
    1 = <>
    2 = &Doszip directory,[Doszip]

    [Doszip]
    0 = Doszip &Command Line, %DOSZIP%\DZ.EXE -?
    1 = View &DZ.INI, %VIEW% %DZ%\DZ.INI
    2 = View &DOSZIP.TXT, %VIEW% %DZ%\DOSZIP.TXT
    3 = Search &Source Directory, %FIND% %DOSZIP%\src\*.*
    4 = Search &Include Directory, %FIND% %DOSZIP%\inc\*.*
    5 = <>
    6 = &Previous Menu..,[Tools]


<> The File Search utility

    The File Search utility use the short keys Ctrl-S or Shift-Tab, but
    from the command line or configuration file you can use the macro:

    %find% <directory> <file_mask(s)> <text_to_find_in_files>

    Example: %find% %doszip% *.h *.inc *.c *.asm ?

    Shortkeys
    ---------

    F2	 - Save result to list file.
    F3	 - View current file - same as Enter.
    F4	 - Edit current file - exit and execute external editor.
    F5	 - Launch the Operation Filter dialog.
    F6	 - Toggle ascii/hex search string.
    F7	 - Start a new search.
    F8	 - Delete file from list.
    F9	 - Load predefined file mask from .INI file.
    F10	 - Toggle output format
    Esc	 - Exit program.


<> Compare Directories

    The Compare Directories utility use the short key Shift-F5

    It compares Modification Time, Size, and File Name. The result
    is a list from the Target directory found in Source. The default
    Target is Panel-A and the default Source directory is Panel-B.

    Multiple directories may be used as Target: ["C:\my dir" E: F:\doc]

    Shortkeys
    ---------
    F2	    - Save result to list file.
    F3	    - View current file - same as Enter.
    F4	    - Edit current file - exit and execute external editor.
    F5	    - Launch the Operation Filter dialog.
    F6	    - Copy Panel directories to Source/Target.
    F7	    - Start a new search.
    F8	    - Delete file from list.
    F9	    - Load predefined file mask from .INI file.
    F10	    - Advanced settings.
    Esc	    - Exit program.
    Ctrl-F6 - Swap directories and reload.


<> Create List File

    The Create List File utility use the short key Alt-L, or drag and drop
    selected files to the command line. Use F2 in File Search to save list.

    Output format string:

    \\	   \
    \%	   %
    \t	   09
    \n	   0D 0A
    %id	   Index

    %ext   .asm
    %n	   cmmklist
    %p	   /doszip/src/dzmain
    %f	   /doszip/src/dzmain/cmmklist.asm

    %s	   Search string
    %o	   Offset from File Search
    %cd	   Current directory
    %dz	   Doszip directory

    Use F3 to load pre-defined formats from DZ.INI. You may add formats to
    the section [MKList] like a tool menu:

    [MKList]
    0 = <Menu_Item_Name>, [list_file@]<format_string>
    ...
    0 = Delete Files, del %f\n
    1 = <>
    2 = Default &List, filelist.bat@%f\n


<> Operation Filter

    Choosing the Filters button (available on many of the file operation
    panels - such as copy or move) displays the Operation Filters dialog box.

    The filters allow the users to specify file selection based on file name,
    date, size and attributes. The definitions for the Operation Filters used
    are stored in the DZ.CFG file.

    You can modify the [Filter] section of DZ.INI file to add pre-defined
    filters for use in commonly performed searches.

    Use F3 to load pre-defined filters to [Include] and [Exlcude].
    Use F4 to load date from the calendar to [File date].
