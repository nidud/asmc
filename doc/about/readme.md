Asmc Macro Assembler Reference

# About Asmc

Asmc is a slow-burning attempt of making a functional programming language out of assembly. It supports AVX-512 instructions (Masm v14) but the [Version](../symbol/at-version.md) macro is currently set to v10. The assembler is written in assembly and is open source under the GNU General Public License. It runs on Windows and Linux.
