Asmc Macro Assembler Reference

# About Asmc

Asmc is technically a slow-burning design project to make a functional programming language out of assembly. It started as a modified version of JWasm in 2011 with some simple but specific goals:

- Remove the necessity of labels.
- Merge macro and function calls.
- Enable data declaration where you need it.
- Enhanced compatibility with Masm.

Asmc supports AVX-512 instructions (Masm v14) but the [Version](../symbol/at-version.md) macro is currently set to v10.
