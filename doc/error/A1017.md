Asmc Macro Assembler Reference

## ASMC Fatal Error A1017

Missing source filename

ASMC could not find a file to assemble or pass to the linker.

This error is generated when you give ASMC command-line options without specifying a filename to act upon. To assemble files that do not have a .ASM extension, use the /Ta command-line option.

This error can also be generated by invoking ASMC with no parameters if the ASMC environment variable contains command-line options.

_* ML 6.0 compatible error_
