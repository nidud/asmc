Asmc Macro Assembler Reference

## ASMC Nonfatal Error A2166

structure field expected

The righthand side of a dot operator (.) is not a structure field. This error may occur with some code acceptable to previous versions of the assembler. To enable the old behavior, use OPTION OLDSTRUCTS, which is automatically enabled by OPTION M510 or the /Zm command-line option.

_* ML 6.0 compatible error_
