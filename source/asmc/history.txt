Changes in 2.20 - 15 May 2016
- added OPTION SWITCH:[ C | PASCAL | AUTO | TABLE | NOTABLE ]
  The switch comes in two main types: a structured switch (Pascal) or an
  unstructured switch (C). The default type is unstructured.

  switch. The default setting is AUTO.

  Macro function that creates a string in the .DATA segment. The macro accepts
  C-escape characters in the string. Strings are added to a stack and reused if
  duplicated strings are found. The macro returns offset string.
  Example:
	mov eax,@CStr( "\tCreate a \"C\" string: %s%d\n" )
- changed macro @Date to yyyy-mm-dd

  - The .UNTILCXZ do not use LOOPx but DEC ECX, JNZ .REPEAT

Changes in 2.06 - 15 Des 2011
- Made a modified version of JWASM used as a TASM clone. This was used for
  some DOS tools in WinXP. The changes from JWASM was:
  - Uses full or relative path on source files (as given)
